# Introduction

  This project aims to create a wireless system for managing typical household electrical gadgets, allowing for direct control. By connecting a home automation computer to a wireless network, home automation software often provides access to an interface to the home automation system. This project report, titled "Home Automation," offers a complete discussion of home automation in general and the practical implementation that we performed in this project. We have discussed some of the most fundamental modules generally necessary for any home. These modules comprise lighting control, curtain control, fan control, gate control, and security control of the house's outside. All required components and equipment are mentioned, along with a cost analysis, and a brief explanation of cost-effective implementation for a typical home is provided. Moving on, a quick overview of potential upgrades is offered to elevate this project to a higher level.


# Research
  A home automation system makes the operations of various home appliances more convenient and saves energy. With the energy-saving concept, Smarthome or building automation makes life very simple nowadays. It involves automatically controlling all electrical or electronic devices in homes or even remotely through wireless communication. Centralized control of lighting equipment, air conditioning and heating, audio/video systems, security systems, kitchen appliances, and all other equipment used in home systems is possible with this system.

# Advantages

* Managing all of your home devices from one place.
* Flexibility for new devices and appliances.
* Maximizing home security.
* Remote control of home functions.
* Increased energy efficiency.
* Improved appliance functionality.
* Home management insights.

# Disadvantages

* High installation costs.
* A reliable internet connection is crucial.
* Security issues.
* Technological problems in connected homes.
* Helplessness if technology fails.
* Some people may not like intelligent technologies.
* Maintenance and repair issues.
