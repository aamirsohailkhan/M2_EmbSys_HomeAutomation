# Introduction

  This project aims to create a wireless system for managing typical household electrical gadgets, allowing for direct control. By connecting a home automation computer to a wireless network, home automation software often provides access to an interface to the home automation system. This project report, titled "Alexa controlled Home Automation," offers a complete discussion of home automation in general and the practical implementation that we performed in this project. We have discussed some of the most fundamental modules generally necessary for any home. These modules comprise lighting control, curtain control, fan control, gate control, and security control of the house's outside. All required components and equipment are mentioned, along with a cost analysis, and a brief explanation of cost-effective implementation for a typical home is provided. Moving on, a quick overview of potential upgrades is offered to elevate this project to a higher level.

# Hardware Requirements
#### Amazon alexa echo dot
#### ATMEL ATMEGA 16 (an AVR based microcontroller)  
8-bit microcontroller – ATmega16 is a high-performance microcontroller and it can process 8-bit data at a time. It takes 8 bit of data from memory. And utilize low power consumption. Its architecture based on enhanced RISC architecture.

#### PIR sensor 
passive infrared sensors A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors. PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications.

####  Stepper motors 
A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps.

#### LCD display 
is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly

####  Proximity sensor 
A proximity sensor is a non-contact sensor that detects the presence of an object (often referred to as the “target”) when the target enters the sensor’s field. Depending on the type of proximity sensor, sound, light, infrared radiation (IR), or electromagnetic fields may be utilized by the sensor to detect a target. Proximity sensors are used in phones, recycling plants, self-driving cars, anti-aircraft systems, and assembly lines. There are many types of proximity sensors, and they each sense targets in distinct ways.

#### Motor driving IC 
A motor driver IC is an integrated circuit chip which is usually used to control motors in autonomous robots. Motor driver ICs act as an interface between microprocessors in robots and the motors in the robot.

#### Power supply requirements 

#### Transformers (step down) 
A step-down transformer is a type of transformer that converts the high voltage (HV) and low current from the primary side of the transformer to the low voltage (LV) and high current value on the secondary side of the transformer. The reverse of this is known as a step up transformer

#### Diode bridges (500 mA,1A) 
A diode bridge uses diodes as series components to allow current to pass in the forward direction during the positive part of the AC cycle and as shunt components to redirect current flowing in the reverse direction during the negative part of the AC cycle to the opposite rails.

####  Capacitors filter 
A capacitor that is used to filter out a certain frequency otherwise series of frequencies from an electronic circuit is known as the filter capacitor.

####  Voltage regulators 
A voltage regulator is a circuit that creates and maintains a fixed output voltage, irrespective of changes to the input voltage or load conditions. Voltage regulators (VRs) keep the voltages from a power supply within a range that is compatible with the other electrical components.

#### Small heat sinks 
#### Master board (PCB) consisting of regular components which subject to change as per the requirements. 
#### Miscellaneous 
#### LEDs 
A light-emitting diode is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons
#### Switches 
A switch is an electrical component that can disconnect or connect the conducting path in an electrical circuit, interrupting the electric current or diverting it from one conductor to another
#### Connecting wires 
#### LDRs
Light dependent resistors, LDRs, or photoresistors are electronic components that are used to detect light & change the operation of a circuit dependent upon the light levels.
