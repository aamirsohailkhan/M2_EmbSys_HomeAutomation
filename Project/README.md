## Making Home smart !!!!

This project aims to create a wireless system for managing typical household electrical gadgets, allowing for direct control. By connecting a home automation computer to a wireless network, home automation software often provides access to an interface to the home automation system. This project report, titled " Alexa controlled Home Automation system," offers a complete discussion of home automation in general and the practical implementation that we performed in this project. We have discussed some of the most fundamental modules generally necessary for any home. These modules comprise lighting control, curtain control, fan control, gate control, and security control of the house's outside. All required components and equipment are mentioned, along with a cost analysis, and a brief explanation of cost-effective implementation for a typical home is provided. Moving on, a quick overview of potential upgrades is offered to elevate this project to a higher level.
